The Theory behind
=================


Niggli cells
_______________

In general, every Bravai lattice can be totally generated by a minimal unit known as unit cell. 
However, a unit cell is not unique. Obviously, if such a cell is scaled by a intenger factor, 
it will continue to describe the lattice. The smallest unit cell is known as primitive cell. 

Let us define a unit cell by the following vectors

.. math::
   
   \mathbf{a}_1 = (a_{1x},a_{1y})
   
   \mathbf{a}_2 = (a_{2x},a_{2y})

which can also be collected into a matrix

.. math::
   
   A = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
               \mathbf{a}_1\cdot\mathbf{a}_2 & \mathbf{a}_1\cdot\mathbf{a}_2 \\ 
               \mathbf{a}_2\cdot\mathbf{a}_1 & \mathbf{a}_2\cdot\mathbf{a}_2 
         \end{}array} \right)
   

alternativeyl, the cell can be defined as an geometric invariant through the following matrix

.. math::
   
   \tilde{A} = \left( \begin{array}{cc} a_{1x} & a_{2x} \\ a_{1y} & a_{2y}\end{array} \right)



Moreover, in several cases, even the smallest unit cell is not unique. This is because, it can be tipically 
rotated or inverted. A possible solution to this issue to define a unique cell was given by Niggli, and hence 
the name Niggli cell. 

In two dimensionls, a niggli cell satisfies the following conditions:
