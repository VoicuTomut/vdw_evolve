The Theory behind

Niggli cells
_______________

In general, every Bravai lattice can be totally generated by a minimal unit known as unit cell. 
However, a unit cell is not unique. Obviously, if such a cell is scaled by a intenger factor, 
it will continue to describe the lattice. The smallest unit cell is known as primitive cell. 

Let us define a unit cell by the following vectors

.. math::
   
   (a + b)^2 = \mathbf{g}^2 + 2ab + b^2 + d
   
   (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2

Moreover, in several cases, even the smallest unit cell is not unique. This is because, it can be tipically 
rotated or inverted. A possible solution to this issue to define a unique cell was given by Niggli, and hence 
the name Niggli cell. 

In two dimensionls, a niggli cell satisfies the following conditions:
 
- Since Pythagoras, we know that :math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.
